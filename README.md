# dynamicMesh_piston_OpenFoam
1. The mesh is generated by blockMesh in the folder system
2. One can change the velocity of the piston in 0/pointMotionUz
like 
boundaryField
{
    movingWall
    {
		type            uniformFixedValue;
		uniformValue    table
		(
			(0           0)   //(time    velocity in z direction)
			(0.000006   0.4)
			(0.000032   0.4) .....
      
3. post processing by paraFoam
